Ghost Contracts is a web-based tool designed to protect everyday users from hidden exploitation buried in legal documents. Whether it’s a job offer, gig work app, loan agreement, school policy, or lease, people often accept terms they don’t fully understand, packed with confusing legal jargon and potentially harmful clauses. Ghost Contracts solves this by combining Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract, analyze, and simplify contract language.

Users can upload screenshots, images, or PDFs of their contracts. The app then detects risky or manipulative clauses using pre-trained AI models and highlights them in plain, human-friendly language. It also categorizes each section (e.g., termination, data sharing) and flags common red flags based on legal patterns.

The goal is simple: empower individuals with clear, accessible insights into what they’re signing, without needing a legal background. In short, it’s like having an AI-powered legal assistant for the fine print.
